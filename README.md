# Car-Acceptability-Predictor-with-ML
In this app, we are predicting car acceptability using ML models, and deployed using Google Cloud.

# Introduction 

In this project, we predicts whether the car is acceptable or not after the servicing period,so there are 4 measures for this, 
Good, Very Good, Acceptable and Unacceptable.

# Project Flow:-

1) Load the data into dataframe

2) Perform data preprocessing like handling missing values, feature creation, etc.

3) Perform exploratory data analysis and get valuable insigths from the data.

4) Perform feature selection and select the best algorithm that fits the data.

5) Integrating the model with the UI, which is made using Flask and Bootstrap.

6) Deploy the ML web app on google cloud platform.

## Note - I am working on to add the Complete end-to-end description for this project. Please stay tuned!!
